EdgeRIC: Delivering Real-time Intelligence to Radio Access Networks
========================================================================

.. NextG cellular networks must support a wide variety of applications that require radio access with latency, 
.. throughput and reliability guarantees hitherto unavailable. Simultaneously, the environment is becoming in-
.. creasingly dynamic over diverse spectrum bands, user mobility patterns and variable traffic patterns. Com-
.. plex cross layer interactions imply that problems without crisp models are emerging where a data-driven 
.. machine learning approach to optimal resource utilization has value. We introduce EdgeRIC, a real-time RIC 
.. co-located with the Distributed Unit (DU). It is decoupled from the RAN stack, and operates at the RAN timescale.

- EdgeRIC is a platform for **real-time AI-in-the-loop** for decision and control in cellular networks. It is designed to access network and application-level information to execute AI-optimized and other policies in real-time (sub-millisecond) .
