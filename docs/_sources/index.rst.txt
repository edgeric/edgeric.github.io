EdgeRIC: A Real Time Radio Intelligent Controller
========================================================================

Radio Access Networks (RANs) are increasingly softwarized and accessible via data-collection and control interfaces. 
RAN intelligent control (RIC) is an approach to manage these interfaces at different timescales. We introduce EdgeRIC, a real-time RIC co-located with the
Distributed Unit (DU). It is decoupled from the RAN stack, and operates at the RAN timescale. EdgeRIC
serves as the seat of real-time AI-in-the-loop for decision and control. It can access RAN and application-level information to execute AI-optimized and other policies in real-time (sub-millisecond).

Our current status
------------------------



This release is based on srsRAN 4G, we will shortly release our 5G version. We suport:
   - Realtime KPI monitoring: we support the UL/ DL channel conditions and the respective pending buffers for transmission
   - Realtime Control actions: MAC scheduling on the downlink, both AI training and inference capability
